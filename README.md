## Introduction
In the age of machine learning, image classification has become a fascinating domain. This project embodies the task of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. The CNN architecture learns from a dataset of labeled images, enabling it to make predictions on unseen data.

## Features
- High Accuracy: Leveraging CNNs for better performance.
- Real-time Predictions: With the trained model, you can classify new images instantly.
- Interactive Visuals: Visualizations of training and validation accuracy.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [Cats vs. Dogs dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17YHaSX9-7ZifoSRKcoX5bPGQfcfpwJIG/view?usp=drive_link). Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the designated folder before running the code.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone this repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/vanapatlamanasa/dog-cat-classification
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:
  
   cd dog-cat-classification
   
4. Install the required libraries:
  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (CNN for Image Classification.ipynb).
2. Run the cells sequentially to train the model or use a pre-trained model for prediction.
3. Upload an image of a cat or a dog to see the classification result.

## How It Works
The CNN model is structured with convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensionality. The model is then flattened and fed into fully connected layers to produce the final classifications. The dataset can be sourced from Kaggle's Cat vs Dog challenge, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive set of images.
